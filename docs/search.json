My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

My current lab work examines how one anchor protein affects the distribution of a cholinergic neuron receptor in Drosophila brain, which plays a part in the circus responsible for decision-making.\nBesides research, I had been worked closely with various analytical assays commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry, ranging from physiochemical to cell biological. Two antibody drug development projects I participated have been approved for IND.\nBefore graduate school, I completed my BS degree in cell and molecular biology at the University of British Columbia in Canada. I lived in Vancouver for more than five years to complete my undergrad degree with co-op program.\nAside from academic, I am passionate about movie evaluation, music, and ice-skating.\n\n\nEducation\nPhD: Biology - CWRU Faculty of Science, 2023 - present\nBS: Cell and Molecular Biology - University of British Columbia, 2016 - 2021\n\n\nWork Experience\nAnalytical Scientist 09/2021-09/2022 - WuXiBiologics, Shanghai, China\n\nProvided technical support for biologic drug analysis experiments such as iCIEF, SDS CE, SEC, and IEX .
